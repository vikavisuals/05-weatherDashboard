## Description
A weather application that displays a 5-day forecast to any searched city. OpenWeather API was used to pull in this data, as well as appropriate icons. Previously searched cities are displayed, for convenient access to points of interest for the user.

## Technologies
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- OpenWeather API
- Bootstrap
- Google Fonts

## Challenges
- This was my first full dive into working with an API, because so much of the application relied on its data. I found myself using one way to collect information, and then switching to a different method as I progressed with my build, eliminating a decent amount of code.
- LocalStorage is a reliable tool, though I'm still learning how to best utilize the tool. Saving information is one thing, but extracting information in a readable format is completely different. Displaying that information after a page reload has been a bit of a struggle.
- I've become much more confident in using Bootstrap and jQuery as a result of this project, not to mention API functionality.
- Paying mind to every small detail has saved this project a few times, a missing comma or bracket really matters!
- I used this project to practice using a form of 'dev mode', meaning I copied all of my code over to a backup location when experimenting with large changes. This has prevented me from losing valuable work as well as given me the security of testing plenty of project-transforming ideas out.
